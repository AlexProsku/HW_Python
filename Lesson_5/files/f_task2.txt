To improve my understanding of the Python programming language, I wanted to provide a brief account of its history and the present state of the language.

Python was originally conceptualized by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s as a member of the National Research Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science. Initially, it was designed as a response to the ABC programming language that was also foregrounded in the Netherlands.
Among the main features of Python compared to the ABC language was that Python had exception handling and was targeted for the Amoeba operating system (go Python!).
Fun fact. Python is not named after the snake. Itâ€™s named after the British TV show Monty Python.
